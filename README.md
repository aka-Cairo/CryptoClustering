# Cryptocurrency Clustering with PCA and KMeans

This project demonstrates how to cluster cryptocurrencies using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans clustering. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, determining the optimal number of clusters with an elbow curve, and clustering cryptocurrencies using KMeans.

## Project Structure

- `crypto_clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the project.
- `crypto_market_data.csv`: Dataset containing market data for cryptocurrencies.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- plotly (optional, for interactive plots)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib plotly`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `crypto_clustering.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.
4. Modify the code as needed for your specific use case.

## Dataset

The dataset (`crypto_market_data.csv`) contains market data for various cryptocurrencies, including price change percentages over different time periods.

## Results

- The project demonstrates how to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data using PCA and KMeans.
- It provides visualizations such as elbow curves for determining the optimal number of clusters and scatter plots for visualizing the clusters.
- The README.md file provides a brief overview of the project, its structure, dependencies, and usage instructions.
